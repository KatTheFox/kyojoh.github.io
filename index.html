    <h1>Facebook and Willful Ignorance</h1>
    <p>
      It's not exactly a secret that Facebook mostly ignores ethics in its
      operations. Recent events have once again put Facebook in the news, as
      leaked internal documents reveal more about the company's inner workings.
      Most notably, leaked internal research by Facebook reveals that they were
      aware that Instagram, which they own, is harmful to a large portion of its
      audience, especially teenage girls. Publicly, they never released the
      research, and claimed to media that Instagram had 'positive mental health
      effects,' which completely contradicts the actual results of the study.
      Facebook now has an ethical dilemma, since they know how their product is
      affecting users. It seems fairly clear that the path they have chosen is
      to simply attempt to cover it up.
